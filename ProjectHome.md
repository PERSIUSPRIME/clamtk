# Notice #

We're moving to [github](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk/)! It's not a big deal - we only used the Google code page for tracking issues anyway, and the download links will stay the same thanks to [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dave_theunsub/clamtk)!

The move is because Google code is shutting down.  [Here's](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) the story if you weren't aware.

# Introduction #

ClamTk is a graphical front-end for ClamAV using Perl and Gtk libraries.
It is designed to be an easy-to-use, lightweight, on-demand antivirus scanner for Linux systems.
February 2015 marks our eleventh year!

This page provides information on and downloads for ClamTk and some associated programs - notably, thunar-sendto-clamtk, nemo-sendto-clamtk, and clamtk-kde, which provide context menu functionality for file managers.

**Need assistance?** Please use email or this [link](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/clamtk/issues). The [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/clamtk/w/list) pages are not a substitute for this, and will probably go unread.

From this page, you can download Fedora and CentOS rpms as well as Debian and Ubuntu debs.  There are builds for older distributions such as Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6. You can also install thunar-sendto-clamtk, nemo-sendto-clamtk, and clamtk-kde if you like to have a right-click, context menu in your file manager.

The builds on this page utilize Gtk2.  A build with a new design using Gtk3 is underway.
