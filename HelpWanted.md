# Introduction #

Why, yes, I do need help.  And don't worry - you **can** get involved in Open Source even if you're not a programmer.


# I'm NOT a programmer - how can I help? #

  * Are you a good writer?  We need someone to take over WIKI duties.
Also, maybe you'd like to write documentation for how to use these programs?

  * Do you read/write in more than one language?  Great!  Go here:

  * Do you like to package and release programs?

Great, let me know!

  * You can design really nice icons?

Awesome!  Contact me.

# I AM a programmer - how can I help? #

  * Do you write Python?  We need someone who can maintain this file:

  * Do you write Perl?

Great, let me know how we can improve ClamTk.  The source is here:
